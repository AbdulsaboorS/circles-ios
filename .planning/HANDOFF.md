# Shared Handoff

Repo-wide coordination only. Keep this file short.

Use it for:
- what is on `main`
- active worktrees when they exist
- merge sequencing
- overlap risks

Do not use it for session history, long QA plans, or feature specs.

## Current Repo State

### Default Branch
- `main`

### On Main
- Phase 13 UI/UX pass is complete
- Journey tab shipped
- Profile hero/settings polish shipped
- Phase 14 Meaningful Habits is built and awaiting hands-on validation
- Phase 15 Social Pulse is now merged to `main`
- Phase 15 rollout and combined end-to-end notification QA remain intentionally deferred

### Active Worktrees
- none currently tracked as active in this handoff

### Open Planning Thread
- Onboarding gap audit complete (2026-04-25). See memory `onboarding_audit_2026-04-25.md` for the four gaps (A camera priming, B Moment demo, C mirror copy, D plan reveal). Next session: finalize plan, then build. Do not re-run app-onboarding-questionnaire skill.

### Product Priority Order
1. Test onboarding bugs and fix them
2. Do the full UI/UX pass
3. Finalize the name
4. Finalize the logo
5. Work on landing-page video animations and onboarding animations if needed

## Integration Hotspots

- `Circles/CirclesApp.swift`
- `Circles/ContentView.swift`
- `Circles/Navigation/`
- `Circles/Services/`
- `Circles/Profile/`
- `Circles/Home/`
- shared notification models and routing

## Coordination Rules

- one active stream per `git worktree`
- one branch per stream
- no direct commits to `main` unless the user explicitly wants main updated
- keep this file repo-wide and current-state only
- keep detailed QA notes outside startup docs
